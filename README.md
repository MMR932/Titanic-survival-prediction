# Titanic-survival-prediction
A project to predict Titanic survival by comparing three machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and k-NN. Includes data cleaning, EDA, and model evaluation.

This project is a classic machine learning classification problem focused on predicting passenger survival from the sinking of the RMS Titanic. Using the Titanic dataset loaded directly from the Seaborn library, this repository walks through the entire data science pipeline, from analysis to a comparison of model performance.

Key Features:
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and preparing the data for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): ðŸ“Š Visualizing the data to uncover patterns and relationships between passenger features (like age, class, and sex) and their survival outcome.

Feature Engineering: Creating new, informative features from the existing data to improve model performance.

Model Building & Comparison: ðŸ¤– Implementing and comparing three different classification models:

Logistic Regression

Naive Bayes

K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

Model Evaluation: Assessing and comparing the performance of each model using key classification metrics to determine the most effective one.

Technologies Used:
Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook
